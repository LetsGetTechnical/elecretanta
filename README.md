# Secret Santa Exchange ðŸŽ…

Secret Santa Exchange is an AI-powered Secret Santa platform that makes gift exchanges delightful and effortless. Perfect for organizing gift exchanges between colleagues, friends, and family, Secret Santa Exchange takes the guesswork out of gift-giving with personalized AI suggestions.

## ðŸŽ„ Hackathon Project

This project was created for the Let's Get Technical (LGT) discord community hackathon in December 2024.

## Prompt

Greetings Elves! Christmas is around the corner and Santa needs your help. Billions of people participate in Secret Santa and many of them have no idea what they want for Christmas. Vise versa, many gifsters have no clue what kind of gift to give and want to ensure they're buying something valuable for their secret Santa. He needs a web application built that allows users to login and provide what they enjoy in life. This will help the secret Santa individuals narrow down a gift using Elecretanta (el-cre-tan-ta), our Elf Secret Santa AI technology.

Elecretanta has a special algorithm. It gathers users likes, hobbies, and uses the groups spending budget to find the best gift options. Who wants a lousy gift that will sit in storage?! No one. Allow Elecretanta to find gifts for individuals that wont be forgotten after the day of gift exchange.

Requirements from Santa:

- Allow user to save their profile

- Ability for user to fill out their likes and or hobbies via text or image

- Group creation with a budget for gifts

- Usage of AI to help find gift ideas
